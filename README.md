This program visiualizes fractals in Pygame.

The program features the following fractal functions:
1. **Mandelbrot Set**
2. **Burning Ship**
3. **Nova**

When first using the program, you'll need to solve the function first. When solving a function, 
the program will also serialize and save the render data, **not the image itself**.
