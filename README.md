This program will visiualize fractals in Pygame.

I've coded the **mandelbrot**, and the **burning ship** function as well as a botched **nova** function.

When first using the program, you'll need to solve the function first. When solving a function, 
the program will also serialize and save the render data, **not the image itself**.
